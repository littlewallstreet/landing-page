                    <p>The idea for little wall street came out of our interest in finance, and the stock market. 
                        Our passion for the worlds of business and finance were frequently cut short by how little we really knew, and our efforts to learn could only lead so far before we hit a barrier and found ourselves in need of a formal education. 
                        We figured that we could use our base understanding and share with all groups, ages, and backgrounds so that they could gain a better understanding of the stock market and the world of investing and that maybe through the use of our website, they could make their first investment. 
                        Our hope for the xyz charity program is that we can raise money for people who in the past could not consider investing in the stock market and use the information available on our website to not only make their first investment but also learn a valuable skill.
